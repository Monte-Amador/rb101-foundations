## Missed Questions
7. Read the below statements regarding `each` and identify all the statements which are correct. You may assume that the block doesn't terminate the method prematurely. *I actually stumbled on the wording of this one, there's not really any problem with my knowledge of the `#each` method at this point.*

10. Identify all the code samples which **are** examples of selection. *This was a slip up on me being too impatient and not realizing the effect of the loop itself. Because a part actually transformed part of the original.*

11. Identify all the code samples which are **not** examples of transformation. *Now this one was a real headache to finally arrive at an understanding. It looks like what tripped me up on the answer was the return
value of a for loop in that it simply returns the original expression [like `#each`] instead of what I thought would be returned.*

18. Given an array `numbers` which contains both odd and even integers; create two new arrays, `odd_numbers` which contains the odd integers from the original array and `even_numbers` which contains the even integers. *I
totally didn't register this when I was looking at it, even testing it. I must have needed to take a break but kept going.*

20. Your team is asked to refactor some legacy code used by the marketing team. One of the requirements of the project is to change the implementation from using basic looping structures to using iterative methods instead.
*Annoyingly, yes, I did the same thing and accidentally left the check mark tagged on the answer, which didn't have to be that way. I knew it was wrong but I had been on the computer for far too long to see the obvious error.*

So that wraps up the bulk of my errors on the items I missed. Mostly due to lack of concentration due to being impatient most likely. Great chapter, great practice.
