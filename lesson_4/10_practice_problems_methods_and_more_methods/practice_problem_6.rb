#### Practice Problem 6

# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?
[ 'ant', 'bear', 'catepillar' ].pop.size

## My Answer
# It should return 1 because the size method is working with the returned
# value from the pop method. I was close, I originally thought the pop method
# would pull the last item in the array as an array itself, instead it
# returned the string which would equate to 10 using the size method on that
# string.
