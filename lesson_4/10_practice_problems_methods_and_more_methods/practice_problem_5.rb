#### Practice Problem 5

# What does `shift` do in the following code? How can we find out?

hash = { a: 'ant', b: 'bear' }
hash.shift # => [:a, 'ant']

# Shift has documentation that is available from the link: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.0.0/Hash.html#method-i-shift
# According to the docs, it looks like the shift method will remove a
# key-value pair and return it as a two item array [key, value] or the hash's
# default value should the hash be empty.
