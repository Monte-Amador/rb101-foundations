# Question 2:
# A would work however it is calling the number.to_i.odd? which won't
# equate to the index value equating to odd.
# B Will create the odd_numbers array as expected but the for loop won't
# return anything other than the original array.
# C Will create the odd_numbers array as well
# D Will similarly create the odd_numbers array but beware that the each
# method will only return the original numbers array

# Question 3:
# Initially threw off because of the `-` in front of the counter variable,
# but now I see that it was for returning from the beginning for the array.
# So therefore A works
# B will work even though there are a lot of counter variables sprinkled
# throughout. 
# C threw me off, but does in fact work. I got confused by the assignment of
# `counter = 0` from within the `for loop`.
# D
