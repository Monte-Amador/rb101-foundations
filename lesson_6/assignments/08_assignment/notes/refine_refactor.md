- [ ] bug: choosing anything allows the game to continue.
- [ ] clear screen at beginning 
- [ ] remove continuous deck and allow for the reshuffle after every iteration of hand.
- [ ] if player receives 21 at the initial deal, it still asks if the player wants to hit or stay
- [ ] aces are simply choosing between 1 of the two values in the array. Perhaps all values for aces are 11 but the method can change the value to 1 if the total would equate to a bust with 11. 
- [ ] display should be in this order:
  - clear screen
  - display all visible cards for both dealer and player
  - display 21 message if player gets 21 from deal and go to winner
  - if player stays, we see their cards again but that should be removed as the top of the screen still shows the current hand.
  - we need to clear the screen when a new card is dealt to shed focus on the new card, then clear the screen and reboot the current hand standings that include the new card before hit or stand during player turn. For the computer turn we don't ask for hit or stand, but some feedback as to what the dealer will do will be nice.
  - bug: once the dealer's turn begins the screen gets cleared and updates the current hand with the new card
