# Trust the Process 

I've actually been pretty stymied with the concept of writing about my experience with Launch School. The whole thing is overwhelming to strip down to a few words strung togehter. most of the hesitation is simply because of the sheer vertical climb that has been transpiring over the course of the past few months.

I remmeber starting with the prepatory course and was so enchanted with the approach that Launch School developed that I could'nt ignore the pull it had on me. To completely trust the course, the material and most importantnly, the _way_ they come together was to ultimately trust myself in this path.
