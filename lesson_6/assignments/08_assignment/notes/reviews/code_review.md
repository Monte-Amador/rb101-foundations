Code Review Request: 21 w/Bonus Features

I would like to ask for a code review on my [21 bonus features](https://github.com/Monte-Amador/rb101-foundations/blob/main/lesson_6/assignments/08_assignment/twentyone_bonus.rb) assignment. Any feedback is very welcome, thank you!

I am using rubocop `0.86`

One question I have is about the multitude of variables being assigned in a method. In my code, the `deal` method has a lot of variables assigned throughout the method in order to make it more readable while I was assembling the string. Although it works as is, I would like to know of any better practices/suggestions that would make this more succinct.

Additionally, the `user_turn` method had a very intricate rubocop offense that I spent a lot of time working out. In the end, I got it reduced considerably and rubocop 0.86 seems to be happy with it. Still though, any suggestions specifically on how to better handle this kind of situation where I am trying to combine two very similar methods into one would be very welcome.

Thank you all for your great invaluable support!
