## May 25, 2021 wrapping up the assignment bonus features 
there's a sense of wonder now that the road blocks have gotten fewer and further between. I remember when i started the prepatory course and I could just sit there unawares of what I had just learned. I questioned many times whether i could stick through it as I continually felt lost. That's the bulk of how i went to bed every night for the 8 weeks it took me to finish. 

Now, I feel like this sense of wonder is sstarting to grow some serious tendrils and I have no idea what to expect. But I so enjoy the process I can't wait to see this fly. I feel like... the music sounds better with you[video]

Lately, I am starting to feel the wonder of that boy in the video. So excited, dedicated, jamming, a little nervous but more than anything, wonder.
