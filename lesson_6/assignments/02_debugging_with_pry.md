> Earlier in the course we introduced some debugging techniques, including the basics of using pry. As programs get larger and grow in complexity, the likelihood of bugs occuring in your code increases. When dealing with larger programs it is even more important to know how to identify and eliminate bugs when they occur. Before continuing with this lesson we recommend that you review this assignment.

Earlier in the course we introduced some debugging techniques, including the basics of using `pry`. As programs get larger and grow in complexity, the likelihood of bugs occuring in your code increases. When dealing with larger programs it is even more important to know how to identify and eliminate bugs when they occur. Before continuing with this lesson we recommend that you review [this assignment](https://launchschool.com/lessons/a0f3cd44/assignments/e742d62a).

We recommend that you watch this optional video which takes a more in-depth look at debugging with `pry` and also introduces using `pry` as a debugger through the use of `pry-byebug`. Using `pry-byebug` dramatically increases `pry`'s ability to help you pinpoint and fix bugs.

**Note:** If possible, watch this video in full-screen mode to better read the provided code examples.
