Nice work, time for the refactoring so let's be smart and save the current file over the main 5 file. This is the testing ground file that we want to copy into the main 5 file. Then we continue working on the ground file.

Follow the breadcrumbs from /Users/monte/Projects/launch-school/rb101-programming-foundations/lesson_6/assignments/07_assignment_ttt_bonus_features/notes

and enjoy the ride. Note that we really want this to be a testimony to how far you've come along on this. Make it your best.
