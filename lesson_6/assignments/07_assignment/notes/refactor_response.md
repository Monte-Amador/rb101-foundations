Hello Mia,

I am just letting you know that I've updated the TTT game as per your suggestions. Your suggestions helped instruct my approach as well. I hadn't even considered reducing the logic more in the detect and validation methods for the offense/defense. That was super helpful. 

If you have any further thoughts or suggestions please feel free to share more but thank you once again for your time and the feedback.

Warm regards,
Monte
