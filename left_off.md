Paramount to really mastering the small problems and get prepared for the
assesments is to read this over a couple times [Working with RB101-RB109 Small Problems Exercises](https://launchschool.com/gists/2a3a3d72)

Just finished some of the small problems with the documentation and moved
onto the [Easy 1](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/3adc7fa4). Overall
that was a humbling ride but it got better towards the end. What I noticed is
that it was only hard due to the sheer amount of time I hadn't been able to
devote to studying.Finished with [Easy 1](https://launchschool.com/exercise_sets/3adc7fa4).
